# Generate random numbers *Challenge 1*

Create a generator function that allows us to obtain an n number of random numbers.

The generator must meet the following requirements.
The generator must have random names.
It will be possible to indicate to the generator the amount of random numbers to obtain. This of course in the function call.
If the number of random numbers is not indicated, the default will be 5.
The random numbers to be returned will range from 1 to 100.


### Example
- generatort() -> 0,29,82,1,39 without numbers 5 by default
- generatort(2) -> 130,38 or put the N value

# Even numbers within a sequence *Challenge 2*

Develop a program which allows us to know all the even numbers that are within the range of x and y.
The program must meet the following requirements.
Define a function called range_pairs.
The function must have two parameters, x and y.
the function must receive as arguments the values ​​for x and y.
where x is a positive number greater than 0 given by the user.
where y is a positive number greater than x given by the user.
The function must return a list with all the even numbers that exist between the range x and y.
To test the programming you can ask the user for the values ​​of x and y via the keyboard. The values ​​must be requested outside the function.


### Example
- range(10,20) = 10,12,14,16,18
- range(57,80) = 58,60,62,64,66,68,70,72,74,76,78

#### Notes
- We need to validate the second number need to be higher
